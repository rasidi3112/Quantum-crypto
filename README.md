## ⚠️ Important Educational Disclaimer

**This project is intended solely for educational and conceptual learning purposes.**

The implementations provided here are:

- **Simplified pedagogical demonstrations**, not production-ready cryptographic code
- **Not constant-time** and therefore vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks
- **Not cryptographically secure** — do not use for any real-world applications
- **Simulations or toy examples** — the Shor's algorithm demonstration uses classical simulation or simplified quantum circuits that do not represent actual cryptanalytic attacks

For production post-quantum cryptography, use established libraries such as:
- [liboqs (Open Quantum Safe)](https://openquantumsafe.org/)
- [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean)
- [pqcrypto](https://github.com/pqcrypto)

## 🔐 Cryptographic Algorithm Comparison

### Classical vs Quantum Security Overview

| Algorithm | Classical Attack Complexity | Quantum Attack Complexity | Current Status |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **RSA-2048** | Sub-exponential (GNFS)¹ | Polynomial time (Shor's)² | Theoretically vulnerable to future quantum computers |
| **AES-256** | ~2²⁵⁶ operations | ~2¹²⁸ operations (Grover's)³ | Currently believed secure with sufficient margin |
| **ML-KEM (Kyber)** | Believed secure⁴ | Believed secure⁴ | NIST FIPS 203 — Standardized |
| **ML-DSA (Dilithium)** | Believed secure⁴ | Believed secure⁴ | NIST FIPS 204 — Standardized |
| **SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+)** | Believed secure⁴ | Believed secure⁴ | NIST FIPS 205 — Standardized |

**Footnotes:**

¹ *The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) has heuristic complexity L_n[1/3, c] where c ≈ 1.9. This is sub-exponential but super-polynomial in the bit-length of N.*

² *Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time with respect to the input size. The precise complexity depends on implementation details including the arithmetic circuits used for modular exponentiation and the fault-tolerance overhead. Often cited as O(n²log(n)log(log(n))) or O(n³) depending on assumptions about circuit depth and gate counts. These figures should be understood as asymptotic and implementation-dependent.*

³ *Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search, reducing brute-force key search from 2²⁵⁶ to approximately 2¹²⁸ operations for AES-256. This margin is currently believed sufficient for long-term security.*

⁴ *"Believed secure" indicates that no efficient classical or quantum algorithm is currently known to break these schemes. Security is based on the presumed hardness of underlying mathematical problems (e.g., Module-LWE, hash function properties) under current cryptanalytic knowledge. This is not a mathematical proof of security.*

##  Understanding Shor's Algorithm

### What Shor's Algorithm Demonstrates

Shor's algorithm (1994) is a **quantum algorithm** that can factor integers in polynomial time, which would break RSA, DSA, and Elliptic Curve cryptography if implemented on a sufficiently powerful, error-corrected quantum computer.

### Important Clarifications

| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **What this project demonstrates** | Classical simulations and simplified quantum circuit concepts using Qiskit |
| **What this does NOT represent** | An actual cryptographic attack or a threat to real-world RSA keys |
| **RSA-2048 status** | **Far beyond current quantum capabilities** — no existing quantum computer can factor numbers of cryptographic relevance |
| **Toy examples** | Factoring small numbers (e.g., 15, 21) for educational illustration only |

### Qubit Requirements: A Nuanced View

Estimates for the quantum resources required to break RSA-2048 vary significantly based on architectural assumptions:

| Source | Logical Qubits | Physical Qubits | Key Assumptions |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Gidney & Ekerå (2021)¹ | ~20 million physical qubits | ~20 million | Optimized circuits, 8-hour runtime, surface code error correction with ~0.1% gate error rates |
| Earlier estimates | ~4,000 logical qubits | Millions (dependent on error correction overhead) | Varies by error model and code distance |

**Key Points:**
- **Logical vs. Physical Qubits**: Logical qubits are error-corrected abstractions; each requires many physical qubits (the ratio depends on error rates and error-correction codes)
- **These estimates are model-dependent**: Actual requirements depend on qubit coherence times, gate fidelities, connectivity, and the specific error-correction scheme employed
- **No single number is universal**: Different assumptions yield different estimates

## Quantum Threat Timeline: Uncertainties and Caveats

### Scenario-Based Projections (Speculative)

| Scenario | Timeframe | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Conservative | 2040+ | Assumes slow progress in error correction and qubit coherence |
| Moderate | 2035–2040 | Assumes continued progress consistent with recent trends |
| Optimistic | 2030–2035 | Assumes major breakthroughs in hardware and error correction |

**⚠️ Critical Notes:**

- **All timelines are speculative** and reflect informed estimates, not predictions
- **Expert opinions vary widely** — some researchers believe cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) are decades away, while others suggest shorter timescales under optimistic scenarios
- **NIST has set 2035** as a transition milestone for federal systems to migrate away from quantum-vulnerable algorithms (this is a policy deadline, not a threat prediction)
- **"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL)**: This is a well-founded concern — adversaries may collect encrypted data today with the intent to decrypt it once quantum capabilities mature. This makes early migration strategically important for long-lived secrets.

##  Post-Quantum Cryptography (NIST Standards)

The following algorithms have been standardized by NIST as part of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process:

| NIST Standard | Algorithm Family | Use Case | Underlying Problem |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **FIPS 203 (ML-KEM)** | CRYSTALS-Kyber | Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) | Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) |
| **FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)** | CRYSTALS-Dilithium | Digital Signatures | Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) / Module SIS |
| **FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA)** | SPHINCS+ | Digital Signatures | Hash function security (stateless hash-based) |

**Security Basis:**

These algorithms are **believed to be secure against both classical and currently known quantum attacks**, based on:
- Extensive cryptanalysis during the NIST standardization process
- The presumed hardness of lattice problems (for ML-KEM and ML-DSA) and hash function properties (for SLH-DSA)

**This belief is based on current cryptanalytic knowledge, not unconditional mathematical proof.**

As with all cryptography, security assumptions may evolve as new attacks are discovered.

**Remember**: This project demonstrates *theoretical concepts*. The quantum threat to cryptography is **real but not imminent**. Current quantum computers are not capable of breaking cryptographically relevant key sizes. However, the strategic importance of early preparation — particularly for data with long-term secrecy requirements — is widely recognized by the cryptographic community.

> *"It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."* — attributed to various sources

Begin exploring post-quantum cryptography today, but approach timeline claims with appropriate scientific skepticism.
